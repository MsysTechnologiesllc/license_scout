    How to fix this depends on what information license_scout was unable to
    determine:

    * If the package is missing license information, that means license_scout was
      unable to determine which license the package was released under. Depending
      on the package manager, this is usually specified in the package's metadata,
      for example, in the gemspec file for rubygems or in the package.json for npm.
      If you know which license a package was released under, MIT for example, you
      can add an override in license_scout's overrides.rb file in the section for
      the appropriate package manager like this:
        ["package-name", "MIT", nil]

    * If the package is missing the license file, that means license_scout could not
      find the license text in any of the places the license is typically found, for
      example, in a file named LICENSE in the root of the package. If the package
      includes the license text in a non standard location or in its source repo,
      you can indicate this by adding an override in license_scout's overrides.rb
      file in the section for the appropriate package manager like this:
        ["package-name", nil, ["https://example.com/foocorp/package-name/master/LICENSE"]],

      If you know that the package was released under one of the common software
      licenses, MIT for example, but does not include the license text in packaged
      releases or in its source repo, you can add an override in license_scout's
      overrides.rb file in the section for the appropriate package manager like
      this:
        ["package-name", nil, [canonical("MIT")]]
