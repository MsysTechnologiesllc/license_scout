These fixtures represent a set from an omnibus build which looks pretty
different than the original rebar fixtures. The set of dependencies are reduced to these 4 specific things:

* bifrost => The project itself
* data_collector => An app inside the project
* edown => No license info
* eper => With license info
* mochiweb => Comes as a pkg
